# Nightmares of AVL Trees
## I'm completely fine with this README being a mess...

### Explanation
  * UTrees are a data structure that implement AVL Tree rotations.
  * DTrees are a data structure that are also self-ordering, but with a different procedure.
  * Each UTree Node contains a string and a DTree.
  * Each DTree Node contains a numerical discriminator (integer).
  * The test script is crazy long... See the function prototypes for an idea of what I'm looking for.
